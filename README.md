# Stupid-Impossible-

#Game made with Zelle Graphics. To start the game you have to access the "Stupid_Impossible.py" file.

#Similar to the Impossible Flash game, you the user control a circle ball and have to navigate through 7 difficult levels, dodging the fireballs and reach the coin (through collision) to advance to the next level. Each level is slightly more challenging than the last.

#Concepts used are the Zelle Graphics library, multiple functions creating the different levels, collision, boundary collision to keep the player & fireballs within the map, if & elif & else statements, for loops, breaking the for loop, and importing my own module library that I created for the Window & Movement Variables stored under "Game_Variables.py"
